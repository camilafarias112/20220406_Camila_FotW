In this repo I give an example of how to use the R packages tm and ggwordcloud in the context of biology and gene expression.
I always had trouble thinking about a good way to plot the clustered outputs generated by DAVID https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp (for Gene Ontology Analysis), from a list of genes of interest.
(see example in ~/import_export/GO_BP_Reactome_StaphyDetect.txt)

I discovered that wordclouds are good to visualize the genes in each Annotation cluster. The size of the gene would reflect the number of times that a specific gene was annotated in a geneset, or in other words, how "popular that gene is annotated as that specific term".
Good dataviz for oral presentations.
